<p>Hello. This is my (brief version) CV. You can view a more traditional CV <a href="cv_dan_steward_Feb_2019_final.pdf">here</a> (click once the page has finished loading).</p>
<p>A very quick summary of life since school â€“ 30 years ago; I have a politics degree from Leeds University (1992) and have since worked in advertising, marketing, sales and now work with computers.</p> <!-- comment??? -->
<p>I am currently self-employed running a small computer help company, <a href="https://www.a3computersupport.co.uk/">A3 Computer Support.</a><!-- comment??? -->
<p>I am cutting down on the amount of IT work for the next few months whilst I prepare for a programming exam so I will be able to commit to a fair number of hours to the campaign assistant role.</p><!-- comment??? -->

<p>I have a car and full driving licence.</p><!-- comment??? -->

<p>I have worked a little with Elizabeth Evans in Woking who would give me a reference - although I haven't been in contact with her for a few years now. I can provide other references on request.</p><!-- comment??? -->

<p>As I work in computing/IT and have worked in digital marketing I will be able to help in any of these areas as well.</p>

<p>Extra to this is my desire to see Labour in power as soon as possible. Obvious I suppose.</p>

<p>To contact me please email me dan@a3computersupport.co.uk or call/text 07980690066.</p>
