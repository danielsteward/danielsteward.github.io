Hello. This is my (brief version) CV.
<p>As you may have seen on my GitHub profile I am in the middle of an Open University computing degree.</p> <!-- comment??? -->
<p>Although study is interesting I have discovered that building and coding a real-life application motivates me even more.<a href="link"> portfolio</a>.</p><!-- comment??? -->
<p>I have recently finished a project for a large US company called TNS which involved creating an application that enabled the tracking of their clientâ€™s point of sale devices. This was fascinating as I started from scratch.</p><!-- comment??? -->

<p>Although it was a comparatively small, simple program designing and coding it without any guide apart from non-functional requirements was daunting, frustrating but ultimately wonderful.</p><!-- comment??? -->

<p>It is because of the hands-on experience as describe above that I have put my university study on pause and am currently taking the Oracle Java exams.</p><!-- comment??? -->

<p>I am looking to work for an experienced Java/Android developer (plus all the associated technologies) to gain experience of larger projects and best practices.</p><!-- comment??? -->
